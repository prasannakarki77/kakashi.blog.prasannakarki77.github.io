                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Hatake Kakashi</h3>
                    <p>Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan.
                        Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most
                        talented ninja;
                        regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility.
                        To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson he received,
                        along with the Sharingan,
                        from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes
                        Konoha's Sixth Hokage
                        (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).</p>
                    <p>Kakashi has a strong resemblance to his father, so much so that they are sometimes mistaken for
                        each other.
                        He has spiky silver hair often oriented to his left-side, dark grey eyes (black in several
                        instances),
                        and typically a relaxed and lazy expression. During the Third Shinobi World War, his left eye
                        was damaged, leaving a vertical scar from the injury.
                        The eye was shortly afterwards replaced with a Sharingan, which he covers with his forehead
                        protector when he isn't using it.</p>
